    <h2 id="ab">About</h2>
        <p id="intro"> Pet adventures is a locally owned and operated company, fronted by us, Ellen and Josie. We have a german shepherd, Max, and a kitty, Momo, of our own. While we enjoy them immensely, we love to offer the same joys we give our pets to others. Take a look at some of our services while you're here!</p>

                    <p id="e-bio">Hi! I'm Ellen. I'm 26 years old, a nurse, and a software engineering student of Flatiron. I love our two pets and adventuring with all four us. Hiking, creating new projects, making things aesthetically pleasing, enjoying myself and those around me, and solving problems are some of my favorite things!</p>
